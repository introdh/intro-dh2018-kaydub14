# Grant Workshop

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project.

* What will these networks reveal about the relationships among the women in the House and in Congress?
* How would adding additional parameters such as male relationships change the model?

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, 
clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

In light of this year being election season for midterms, I started to wonder what information could be gathered from the election 
campaigns and donations. That brought me to the idea of women on the campaign trail running for positions within Congress and the House of
Representatives. This is a phenomenon that has been occurring for years but it is starting to gain more traction and more of the cadidates
that are running for the top positions such as govenors, Secretary of State, or even the Supreme Court are women. It would be interesting 
to see this relected using one of the tools of the digital humanities. Since politics are predispoded as a male-dominated, women who are 
campaigning for open positions in politics have to have a strong network of relationships. Using information from past media coverages and
Twitter to see who tagged who during the election season. The NEH grant would focus on building a network to show the relationships with 
other promenient women in politics that the female candidates have had over the years. INformation I think this wouuld help the public to 
be aware of who knows who because it can be difficult to gleam that information from the media. Having this information readily available 
with dates could be helpful with dates could be helpful in solving this problem.

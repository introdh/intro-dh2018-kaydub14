# Written Response for Networks (Assignment #2)

Hello! Welcome to my written response regarding the network that I created. Images of the network can be found below throughout the 
written response. I've also createOver the course of this assignment, I explored the relationships that each character in the hit TV show, *The Office*, that aired on NBC.

**1.Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.**

I decided to create my own data for the network that I built. This data was compiled using the cast from the NBC television series, 
*The Office*. This TV series is an American sitcom that aired from 2005 to 2013. The link to the data that was used for the network can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PQ2yLvsuGVgKT_mL2uZw1LSZbdg9ZUU9QIPDdexT_uA/edit?usp=sharing) I specifically chose *The Office* because it's a TV series that I have spent the whole semester watching. I wanted to see what networks could be built from the characters within the show. Given that the TV series is nine seasons, I chose to focus on one episode for the sake of time. The episode was the first episode of season one. I didn't want to delve too deep into the seasons because I wanted the network to show the preliminary relationships that existed at the beginning of the show. 

**2.Explain the questions/arguments your network generates about your data.**

After building my network and seeing the end result of it, I am curious to see how the network would expand and change if more data was gathered. Rather than focus on just one episode, I would want to expand the network to include all nine seasons of *The Office*. I also wanted the network to be bigger but realized that I would have to have a much bigger data set.  

The argument that I can see throughout the network is that the relationships between the characters is not shown. I know that is one of the limitations of a network but it would have been interesting to see if a topic model would be able to note the various relationships. For example, I saw that Michael talked to several people more than once but I only counted those interactions once. Unless the conversation was initiated by another character such Dwight, Jim, or Pam talking to Michael, I limited the other conversations that took place. But I realized as I was building my network that I would have to go back and get more interactions to make my network bigger than just the two interactions that I had between Michael and the other employees. 

I also was interested in seeing if the network would be able to capture the relationships that existed in the beginning. While building the edges which were the relationships, I was  I would have liked to compare this network to the one that covers all nine seasons of *The Office* to see how those relationships change over time. But overall, I was pleased with the outcome of the network.

Also, one of the challenges I faced while building this network was that I struggled with points of comparions. I think that would help with the expansion of the network as well as I would be able to compare the relationships on more factors rather than just gender, relationships, or the role the character plays within *The Office*. 

**3.Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilities and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers.**

The possiblities of network analysis include the following.
* Visualization tool that displays the relationship or connection between two things (Newman, 2010); This is especially helpful in trying to find patterns between a set of data. I was able to see this between the various characters and the roles they played.
* There are many free online options available to help build a network and establish patterns (Newman, 2010).
* Networks can be used to visualize anything (Weingart, 2011).
* Networks are able to define how the documents used in a topic model relate to one another, as opposed to the topic model showing how the words within the document relate to one another. This means that networks present users with an opportunity to see the bigger picture of all of the documents within the corpus (Weingart, 2011).

The limitations of network analysis include the following. 
* Direct visualization of networks is only useful for networks that consists of a few hundred to a thousand nodes (Newman, 2010). 
* Too many edges means that it's hard for the network picture to be visually appealing to the human eye (Newman, 2010).
* Although networks can be used to visualize anything does not mean that they should due to the fact that the actual results may be completely different from the expected results (Weingart, 2011).

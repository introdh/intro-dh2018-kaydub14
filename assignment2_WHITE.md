Hello! Welcome to my written response regarding the network that I created. Images of the network can be found below throughout the 
written response. I've also createOver the course of this assignment, I explored the relationships that each character in the hit TV show, *The Office*, that aired on NBC.

**1.Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.**

I decided to create my own data for the network that I built. This data was compiled using the cast from the NBC television series, 
*The Office*. This TV series is an American sitcom that aired from 2005 to 2013. The link to the data that was used for the network can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PQ2yLvsuGVgKT_mL2uZw1LSZbdg9ZUU9QIPDdexT_uA/edit?usp=sharing) I specifically chose *The Office* because it's a TV series that I have spent the whole semester watching. I wanted to see what networks could be built from the characters within the show. 

**2.Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data.**

After building my network and seeing the end result of it, I am curious to see how the network would expand and change if more data was gathered. Rather than focus on just one episode, I would want to expand the network to include all nine seasons of *The Office*. I also wanted the network to be bigger but realized that I would have to have a much bigger data set.  

**3.Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilities and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers.**

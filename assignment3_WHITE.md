# Assignment #3 - GIS Spatial Analysis

# Part 3 Reflection

The link to my data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ox1uN7AMU5BsM0dt9xV7zdyTBjXOAs18RLhNuGXbaLk/edit#gid=0) as 
well as the link to my StoryMap [here](http://arcg.is/1j9aLv).

**1. Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your 
Storymap.**

The process of building my data took about a week because I had to track all of the places that I went in a spreadsheet. I had to trakc these places using the longitude and latitude coordinates. 

**2. Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and 
place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?**


**3. What are the limits and possibilities of Mapping/Spatial Analysis?**

The possibilities and limits of mapping/spatial analysis are outlined below. 

**Possibilities**
* perspectives (political)
* knowledge production
  - Conditions: within "economy of morality"
* reliance on categories as a way to organize data
* challenge societal norms

**Limits**
* art/not neutral
* complicit in social inequality (ex. racism)
* Reliance on categories means that the categories themselves do not reflect the complexity of that specifc category)

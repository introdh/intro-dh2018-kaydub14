# Part 3 Reflection

The link to my data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ox1uN7AMU5BsM0dt9xV7zdyTBjXOAs18RLhNuGXbaLk/edit#gid=0) as 
well as the link to my StoryMap [here](http://arcg.is/1j9aLv).

**1. Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your 
Storymap.**

The process of building my data took about a week because I had to track all of the places that I went in a spreadsheet. I had to track 
these places using the longitude and latitude coordinates in Google maps. I then downloaded the data as a CSV file so it could be 
uploaded to ArcGIS Online. Using ArcGIS, I uploaded my data represented in the CSV file so that my points or the places I went to could 
be reflected in the map. While building the map, I decided that I would just highlight the events that were most important to me in 
order to tell my perception of space and place. That's why I only picked the places that really meant the most to me regardless of 
whether it was in the city or on campus. 

**2. Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space 
and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?**

Bodenhamer and Crampton both discuss how GIS tends to leave out the complexity of the humanities so it's difficult to reflect space and 
place within GIS. It fails to show the complexity of various relationships or different points on a map. But in order to address this 
issue, I think that the creator of the map has to really think about how they want their map to be perceived. That would be an easy 
solution to this issue. Another fix to this issue is to add multiple layers in a map to further stress the relationship between two 
things. There is also the plain solution of explaining in the decription box within ArcGIS the story behind the image, map, or webpage. 
But either way, the creator has to be careful as to how they want to present their information because even just a simple mishap can 
change the way the intended audience sees. 

**3. What are the limits and possibilities of Mapping/Spatial Analysis?**

The possibilities and limits of mapping/spatial analysis are outlined below. 

**Possibilities**
* perspectives (political)
* knowledge production
  - Conditions: within "economy of morality"
* reliance on categories as a way to organize data
* challenge societal norms

**Limits**
* art/not neutral
* complicit in social inequality (ex. racism)
* Reliance on categories means that the categories themselves do not reflect the complexity of that specifc category)

All of these possiblities and limits are courtesy of Jeremy Crampton who wrote this in 2010. Although these are the limits and possiblities of mapping/spatial analysis, it's also important to take into account that the field of GIS still has a ways to go in terms of taking into account all complexities of the relationships between space and place involved.

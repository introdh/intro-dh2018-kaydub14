# Written Response for Topic Modeling Assignment 1

This is my written response to the topic model that I created. I've included a link to my topic model [here.](https://github.com/kaydub14/dh-topic-models) 
Over the course of this assignment, I explored many trends and patterns in the *Journal of
African American Studies*. I was thoroughly intrigued by the patterns that came up and will delve further into my findings below. 

**1. What is the scope of the journal?**

The scope of the journal is to provide pertinent information to the African American community in order to help the community better learn 
how to interact with the society around it.

**2. What question(s) are you trying to answer?**

* What information was covered in the journal?
* Why was it important? 
* Who was the intended audience of this journal?

**3. Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specify the kind of data and periodization.**

I selected the data in the *Journal of African American Studies*. This journal provided quarterly coverage from 2003-2014. However,
the journal did experience a title change in 2002. The journal was previously known as *Journal of African American Men from 1995-2002*. I
decided not to include the data from the *Journal of African American Men* due to wanting a small data set. The data set I built the corpus
around from the *Journal of African American Studies* included around 640 journal entries. 

**4. Why the number of topics?**

**5. What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?**

**6. Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?**

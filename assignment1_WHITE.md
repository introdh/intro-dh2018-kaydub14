# Written Response for Topic Modeling Assignment 1

Howdy! Welcome to my written response to the topic model that I created. I've included a link to my topic model [here.](https://kaydub14.github.io/dh-topic-models/) 
Over the course of this assignment, I explored many trends and patterns in the *Journal of
African American Studies*. I was thoroughly intrigued by the patterns that came up and will delve further into my findings below. 

**1. What is the scope of the journal?**

The scope of the journal is to provide pertinent information to the African American community in order to help the community better learn 
how to interact with the society around it.

**2. What question(s) are you trying to answer?**

* What information was covered in the journal?
* Why was it important? 
* Who was the intended audience of this journal?

**3. Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specify the kind of data and periodization.**

I selected the data in the *Journal of African American Studies*. This journal provided quarterly coverage from 2003-2014. However,
the journal did experience a title change in 2002. The journal was previously known as *Journal of African American Men from 1995-2002*. I
decided not to include the data from the *Journal of African American Men* due to wanting a small data set. The data set I built the corpus
around from the *Journal of African American Studies* included around 640 journal entries. 

**4. Why the number of topics?**

The number twenty-five is the number of topics that was assigned during the creation of this topic model. I thought I was going to have to adjust and make it bigger when I saw the initial results from the topic model but after much consideration, I realized that the words that were in groups made logical sense and it was the 'sweet spot' for the number of topics. The groups made logical sense and if I made the number of topics bigger, the existing topic model would be spread too thin and start to repeat itself. I didn't want this to happen so twenty-five is the number of topics. 

I also took the size of my data into consideration because I had a small data set to begin with. My data set only had a little over 630 applicable articles within the journal. Compared to the other data sets that had over thirty thousand articles, I knew that I would not need a large number of topics to avoid repetition. I knew my corpus was going to be more narrow and focused in terms of what words generated under the different topics if I kept it small. 

**5. What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?**

My topic model presented some findings that I was not necessarily surprised by just because of the history of African Americans. I was curious to see if the journal would actually reflect the true story of the history of African Americans and there are patterns that actually support this. Some patterns such as slavery, identity, education, literature, along with some of the well-known black writers during this time period from 1995 to 2014. 

I found it interesting that this more than likely could have been a resource that helped African Americans to cope with the daily struggles they faced since it covered topics that were at the center of what made up African Americans. I also see the trend of showing how far African Americans have come so this journal also could have served as a source of inspiration to the African Americans that read it. These topics are telling us the story of African Americans and how we can move on beyond that story to make the future brighter. I understood the topics to be telling us that despite of coming from a rough background, anyone can make it if African Americans are able to endure the struggle of segregation and Jim Crow laws in the South to reach the point to be able to receive a college degree from an institution of higher learning.

One thing to note in the trend of the topics presented is that not every piece of the story of African Americans I mentioned above is included in this topic model. Topics such as segregation, civil rights, or Jim Crow were not included in this topic model. I thought I could expand the model to included these topics by increasing the number of topics. But I had to stop and realize that the movement for civil rights had already occurred in 1964, which meant that this data would have been outside the scope of what the journal was covering since the corpus itself is based from 1995 to 2014. However, it would be interesting to see how the corpus would change if that data was included. 

The last trend that I noticed was that there were topics such as feminism, movements, and higher education in which the size of the words within these topics were larger than the other topics in the model. I was surprised by this and did further investigation. I figured out that these three topics contained the words that were talked about the most over the course of the publication of *Journal of African American Studies*. Upon discovering this, I realized that my initial thought about this journal being a source of motivation for the African American community could be true due to the fact that the writers were addressing both the past but looking to a brighter future for the African American community. 

**6. Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?**

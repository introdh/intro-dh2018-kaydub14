# Written Response for Topic Modeling Assignment 1

This is my written response to the topic model that I created. I've included a link to my topic model [here.](https://github.com/kaydub14/dh-topic-models) 
Over the course of this assignment, I explored many trends and patterns in the *Journal of
African American Studies*. I was thoroughly intrigued by the patterns that came up and will delve further into my findings below. 

**1. What is the scope of the journal?**

The scope of the journal is to provide pertinent information to the African American community in order to help the community better learn 
how to interact with the society around it.

**2. What question(s) are you trying to answer?**

* What information was covered in the journal?
* Why was it important? 
* Who was the intended audience of this journal?

**3. Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specify the kind of data and periodization.**

I selected the data in the *Journal of African American Studies*. This journal provided quarterly coverage from 2003-2014. However,
the journal did experience a title change in 2002. The journal was previously known as *Journal of African American Men from 1995-2002*. I
decided not to include the data from the *Journal of African American Men* due to wanting a small data set. The data set I built the corpus
around from the *Journal of African American Studies* included around 640 journal entries. 

**4. Why the number of topics?**

The number twenty-five is the number of topics that was assigned during the creation of this topic model. I thought I was going to have to adjust and make it bigger when I saw the initial results from the topic model but after much consideration, I realized that the words that were in groups made logical sense and it was the 'sweet spot' for the number of topics. The groups made logical sense and if I made the number of topics bigger, the existing topic model would be spread too thin and start to repeat itself. I didn't want this to happen so twenty-five is the number of topics. 

I also took the size of my data into consideration because I had a small data set to begin with. My data set only had a little over 630 applicable articles within the journal. Compared to the other data sets that had large amounts of data like 30,000 plus, I knew my corpus was going to be more narrow and focused in terms of what words generated under the different topics. 

**5. What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?**

**6. Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?**

* My preferred pronouns are she/her/hers. 

# Questions
*1. What are you most nervous about this semester?*
* I'm most nervous about balancing all of my responsibilities both as a student and as a RA. I also am taking several reading heavy classes.

*2. What are you most excited about this semester?*
* I'm most excited about learning new subjects that I am actually interested in and not just to fulfill a general education requirement.

*3. Why did you choose to take this course?*
* I chose to take this course due to the description being interesting. The only drawback is that it's so long but we cover so much content in the time we have together.

# Digital
* These are my two favorite memories from over the summer because these were moments I spent with my family.

The video is a link to the Minion Movie trailer that released back in 2015. My dad and I always have loved the minions and their interactions with one another since the first Despicable Me movie came out. I also included a picture of BBQ because I spent a decent amount of time eating and hanging out with my dad's side of the family and there was always something grilled to eat.

Kobi White is a current undergraduate student at the University of Richmond. She is pursuing a degree in Women's Gender and Sexuality 
Studies with a minor in Entrepreneurship. She was exposed to the field of Digital Humanities through her Introduction to Digital 
Humanities course. Here, she was able to learn the tools and background necessary to build an interest in Digital Humanities. Through 
the introduction course, I was able to learn what digital humanities is and how it is applicable to problems that exist in our world 
today. I also was able to learn about each tool of the digital humanities is and how it plays a role in contributing to the overall 
questions that are raised through the humanities. These tools can be presented individually or intertwined together in order to make a 
project with more impact. Due to this introductory course, I will be able to contribute to this project in a visual way through the use of multiple networks. 

Also, to assist with this project, White has assembled a board of advisors to ensure that any advice given would be directly applicable to the project. The instructor of the Introduction to Digital Humanities, Dr. Lauren Tilton, was instrumental in teaching the main concepts of Digital Humanities throughout the course. She has a wide depth of experience and expertise through her research. This is why Dr. Tilton was selected to be on her Board of Advisors for this project. Next, Dr. Melissa Ooten was selected to be a part of the board of advisers because of her background in women and gender studies. She would be helpful in providing additional background information on the women/gender aspect of the project. Lastly, Mrs. Rachel Rigsby was selected to be on the advisory board due to her extensive knowledge of history, as she is a high school AP World History teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas. She would be instrumental in providing the historical perspective of women being added to the House of Representatives and Congress over the last few decades. Together, the advisory board would be greatly beneficial in helping White to further identify any trends that would be applicable to the rise of women running for positions within the House of Representatives and Congress.

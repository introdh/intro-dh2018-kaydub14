# Narrative 

**Enhancing the Humanities (500-1000 words)**

In light of this year being election season for midterms, I started to wonder what important information could be gathered from the 
election campaigns and donations. With my background in women's gender and sexuality studies, I wanted to relate any information that 
I found to be related to this area.

That brought me to the idea of women on the campaign trail running for positions within Congress and the House of Representatives. This 
is a phenomenon that has been occurring for years but is starting to gain more traction and more of the cadidates that are running 
for the top positions such as govenors, Secretary of State, or even the Supreme Court are women. I thought that it would be interesting 
to see this come together using one of the tools of the digital humanities. 

Since politics are predisposed as a male-dominated area, women who are campaigning for open positions in politics have to have a strong 
network of relationships. Using information gathered from past media coverage through news outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox,  and Twitter to see who tagged who during the election season. The NEH grant would focus on building a network to show the relationships with other promenient women in politics that the female candidates have had over the years. INformation I think this wouuld help the public to be aware of who knows who because it can be difficult to gleam that information from the media. Having this information readily available with dates could be helpful with dates could be helpful in solving this problem.


**Environmental Scan (500-1000 words)**

DSL did a mapping project that shows the election of the House of Representatives, which is similar to what will be done throughout the course of my project. But it will be done via a network rather than a map like the DSL has done.

**Biography (250 words)**

Kobi White is a current undergraduate student at the University of Richmond. She is pursuing a degree in Women's Gender and Sexuality 
Studies with a minor in Entrepreneurship. She was exposed to the field of Digital Humanities through her Introduction to Digital 
Humanities course. Here, she was able to learn the tools and background necessary to build an interest in Digital Humanities. Through 
the introduction course, I was able to learn what digital humanities is and how it is applicable to problems that exist in our world 
today. I also was able to learn about each tool of the digital humanities is and how it plays a role in contributing to the overall 
questions that are raised through the humanities. These tools can be presented individually or intertwined together in order to make a 
project with more impact. Due to this introductory course, I will be able to contribute to this project in a visual way through the use of multiple networks. 

Also, to assist with this project, White has assembled a board of advisors to ensure that any advice given would be directly applicable to the project. The instructor of the Introduction to Digital Humanities, Dr. Lauren Tilton, was instrumental in teaching the main concepts of Digital Humanities throughout the course. She has a wide depth of experience and expertise through her research. This is why Dr. Tilton was selected to be on her Board of Advisors for this project. Next, Dr. Melissa Ooten was selected to be a part of the board of advisers because of her background in women and gender studies. She would be helpful in providing additional background information on the women/gender aspect of the project. Lastly, Mrs. Rachel Rigsby was selected to be on the advisory board due to her extensive knowledge of history, as she is a high school AP World History teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas. She would be instrumental in providing the historical perspective of women being added to the House of Representatives and Congress over the last few decades. Together, the advisory board would be greatly beneficial in helping White to further identify any trends that would be applicable to the rise of women running for positions within the House of Representatives and Congress.
